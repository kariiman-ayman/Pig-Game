## 🎮 **How to Play the Pig Game**

The Pig Game is a two-player dice game where the goal is to be the first to reach **100 points**. Here's how it works:

1. **Players take turns** rolling a dice.
2. Each roll adds to the player's **current score**.
3. If a player rolls a **1**, their current score is lost, and the turn passes to the other player.
4. Players can choose to **"Hold"** their current score, adding it to their total score and passing the turn.
5. The first player to reach **100 points** wins! 🏆
